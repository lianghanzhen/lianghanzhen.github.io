# New blog in English

As a Chinese, I never write an article or run a blog in English. Everything is not going be easy at the beginning. I am trying to share my thoughts on programming and design, particularly on mobile device, both iOS and Android. If you do understand what I say, please contact me through social media.

All of my blogs are served by [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/) that is the simplest way to create your own blog. I use [Typora](http://typora.io/) as an editor. As [Typora](http://typora.io/) said in its website, it is a new way to read & write markdown, you don't even have to remember the markdown syntax, it provides so many shortcuts to help you to do that. With seamless live preview, what you see is what you get, so simple and so beautiful. I recommend you guys to have a try.
